## New Yetinauts

Every yetinaut should have an eye out for potential new yetinauts.  We don't have hard and fast criteria, but some of the things that we're looking for are

* Regular activity in github (and ideally the forum as well) over at least a couple of months.
* Multiple high quality PRs merged, especially with nontrivial bugfixes or features.
* Enthusiasm and engagement.  Bias towards positivity and can-do.

## Next Steps

When a potential yetinaut is identified, the existing yetinauts should be consulted to make sure there are no known issues with bringing them on board.  If not, we should take some steps to engage them further, making sure that they continue to be positive and get stuff done.  Examples include:

* Looping them into questions and decisionmaking
* Asking them to tackle particular issues
* Asking them to answer questions on the forum

If after we pull them in to do more, they are engaged and positive and continuing to be helpful, ZURB will extend an invitation to them, and if they accept they will be granted yetinaut status.
