## Who I Am
Web Designer/Developer at a UK advertising agency. Specialising in WordPress development for the last 8 years.

## Problem Domains
My main strengths are with Sass, though I'm happy to help in other areas if I can. Familiar with Gulp and basic JavaScript, strong in WordPress specifics, and I'm a Windows user. I've been using Foundation since version 3 (though didn't use 5 too much).

## What gets me excited about Foundation
I love the idea of one core resource to build a better, more responsive web.
